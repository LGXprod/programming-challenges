# Programming Challenges

This is a collection of my solutions to programming challenges from multiple sources including:

1. [Project Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
2. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (add /year to get previous years additions)
3. [AquaQ Challenge Hub](https://challenges.aquaq.co.uk/)
4. [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/)
5. [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)

Some versions of a solution may not work or only partially completed, which can be determined by the following key located in the problem's readme:

- ‚úÖ = Completed
- üüß = Partially Completed
- ‚ùå = Not Working or Completely Wrong

I will also include the **execution time** of each solution (average of 5 runs) in the problem's readme.
